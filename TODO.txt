- Movement upwards has black square drawing lagged. FIXED
	The problem resides in the variables for SDL_UpdateRect()

- Make continuous left/right movement. DONE

- Add acceleration for left/right movement. DONE

- Add deceleration for left/right movement. DONE

- Does not respond to left/right while decelerating. DONE

- Fix glitch when an arrow is pressed before depressing the other. DONE

- Make all boundaries work. DONE
	- Use variable for size (100). DONE

- Disable manual up/down movement. DONE

- Tweak turning deceleration. DONE
	- Changed the ratio from 2 to 2.2.

- Make the square bounce off a boundary (little effect). DONE

- Make the jumping square actually jump. DONE

- Implement bouncing aticks_endr jumping. DONE

- Add half-frame motion blur: DONE
	- Function to draw square (to memory) in the desired tone. DONE
		- Made *screen and event global(!)
	- New variables for previous-previous position (square_ppx, square_ppy). DONE
	- Make interpolated position variables (square_ix, square_iy). DONE
	- Variables for previous interpolated positions (square_pix, square_piy). DONE
	- Draw black square twice, for the previous frame, and for the previous interpolated frame. DONE
	- Interpolated position -> Draw grey (127). DONE
	- Previous position and previous interpolated position -> Draw black (0). DONE
	- Calculate render area using the three saved positions (x/y, px/py, ppx/ppy) DONE

- Fix motion blur issue w/ selective rendering. DONE
	When turning in both axis, que new black area is not updated, leaving a white trail of the square.
	It should update for:
		- Axis
		- Previous frame
		- Previous-previous: If equal to axis, everything is equal; use axis.
	The update area should fit all three. Always cover from the lowest to highest values.

- Make a script/way to compile for Windows. DONE

- Make it respond to closing the window. DONE
	- Made it close with Esc too.

- Make the Up arrow key jump too. DONE

- Add window title '"Jumping Square" (by hk)'. DONE

- Make the square decelerate slower aticks_endr bouncing off the side. DONE
	- Changed the bounce force quoeficient from 1.2 to 1.1.

- Implement precise frame timing. DONE
	- Added variables:
		- FRAMERATE
		- frametime_target
		- frametime_real
		- (frametime ->) framedelay
		- ticks_start
		- ticks_end
	- Removed variable frametime

- Add DEBUG global variable to enable or disable output to console. DONE

- Make the square have less friction on air. DONE
	- Add/use deceleration_ground and deceleration_air global variables.
	- Add/use gravity variable (vertical acceleration).

- Make the DEBUG variable into a pre-processor macro. DONE
